## Elm bindings for kpdecker/jsdiff (npm 'diff')

This package provides Elm bindings for the [npm diff package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diff).

This currently only works when using [elm-io (maxsnew/IO)](https://github.com/maxsnew/IO), and you must first `npm install diff`.  If you have a desire to see this package work in normal Elm, please contact me or [report a feature request issue](https://github.com/avh4/jsdiff/issues/new).
